This list is a little Chicago-centric, but almost everything has an analogue elsewhere. For instance, if you're in New Zealand you can go on a _bush walk_ while we have to settle for a hike.

### Strategy
Poll the group in advance and allow them to raise concerns, give plenty of options. Some options may not work if you have team members with accessibility needs, or particular concerns. That's _okay_. And keep trying new things!
